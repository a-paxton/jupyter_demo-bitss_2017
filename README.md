# Jupyter for openness and reproducibility

Jupyter notebooks are "living documents" that weave together text, live code, output, and images in a single document. As a result, these notebooks provide researchers with the ability to share their code and document their process in a highly readable, easily sharable workflow across multiple programming languages. Jupyter notebooks can improve reproducibility and transparency when shared with the wider community as supplementary scientific materials for scientific output -- and can improve your sanity by helping you clearly document your own process along the way.

In this brief demonstration, I highlight Jupyter notebook's features using toy notebooks (provided in this repository) and then walk through real-world examples from my own research pipeline (Paxton, Abney, Castellanos, & Sepulveda, 2016; https://github.com/a-paxton/explaining-mechanisms-of-global-warming).
